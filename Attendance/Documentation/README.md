## Introduction  
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Attendance Microservice, covering its architecture, key components, and how it integrates into the overall system, It is intended for developers and DevOps engineers to understand, the document also highlights caching, storage, and deployment practices to ensure performance and reliability.



## What is Attendance API?  
Attendance API is a Python-based microservice designed to manage and track user attendance efficiently.  
It connects to a PostgreSQL database for storage, uses Redis for caching, and handles schema migrations with Liquibase.  
This API ensures high performance, modularity, and ease of integration within larger distributed systems.

### Flow Overview

| Step                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **1. User Interaction** | The user initiates an HTTP request via the **Frontend Web Interface** (e.g., marking attendance, viewing records). |
| **2. Frontend Processing** | The **Frontend Web** receives the request and communicates with the **Attendance API** to perform required operations like fetching, storing, or updating attendance data. |
| **3. Redis Caching** | The **Attendance API** first checks **Redis Cache** to serve data quickly. If data exists, itâ€™s fetched directly from Redis, reducing load on the database. |
| **4. Database Persistence** | If the data is not found in Redis or needs to be stored, the API interacts with **PostgreSQL**, which acts as the primary persistent storage for all attendance records. |
| **5. Response** | Once the request is processed (via Redis or PostgreSQL), the API returns the result to the **Frontend Web**, which formats and sends the final response to the user. |

## **Technology Stack**

- PostgreSQL  

- Redis  

- Poetry  


## **PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL is a great choice for managing attendance data because it handles organized data well, ensures the data is safe and correct through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), and can grow as your project gets bigger.


**For detailed information, look at this PostgreSQL PoC:**

## **Redis**

Redis speeds up the app by storing data in memory, making it ideal for managing user sessions and real-time updates like attendance changes. It's faster than traditional databases for temporary data.

**For detailed information, look at this Redis PoC:**

## **Poetry**

Poetry simplifies managing Python dependencies, ensuring libraries are in sync and making sharing or deploying the app easier, maintaining a smooth development flow.


**For detailed information, look at this Poetry PoC:**

## Conclusion  
The Attendance API uses PostgreSQL, Redis, Liquibase, Poetry, and Gunicorn to deliver a fast, scalable, and reliable attendance management system. These tools ensure secure storage, efficient performance, and smooth deployment. The service is production-ready and easy to maintain.
